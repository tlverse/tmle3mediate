## What's `tmle3mediate`?

`tmle3mediate` is an adapter/extension R package in the `tlverse` ecosystem that
provides support for _causal mediation analysis_, for a range of target
parameters applicable in settings with mediating variables. Causal effects for
which estimation machinery is provided include the popular natural (in)direct
effects [@robins1992identifiability; @zheng2012targeted;
@vanderweele2015explanation], and the less restrictive population intervention
(in)direct effects [@diaz2020causal]. By building on the core `tlverse` grammar
exposed by the `tmle3` R package, `tmle3mediate` accommodates targeted maximum
likelihood (or targeted minimum loss-based) estimation of these causal effect
parameters through a unified interface. For a general discussion of the
framework of targeted minimum loss-based estimation and its relationship to
statistical causal inference, the motivated reader may consider consulting
@vdl2011targeted and @vdl2018targeted. A practical and accessible introduction
using the `tlverse` software ecosystem is provided in @vdl2021targeted (see
https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook).

## Example

To illustrate how `tmle3mediate` may be used to estimate the effect of applying
a stochastic intervention to the treatment (`A`) while keeping the mediator(s)
(`Z`) fixed, consider the following example:

```{r simple_example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(origami)
library(sl3)
library(tmle3)
library(tmle3mediate)

# produces a simple data set based on ca causal model with mediation
make_mediation_data <- function(n_obs = 1000) {
  # baseline covariate -- simple, binary
  W <- rbinom(n_obs, 1, prob = 0.50)

  # create treatment based on baseline W
  A <- as.numeric(rbinom(n_obs, 1, prob = W / 4 + 0.1))

  # single mediator to affect the outcome
  z1_prob <- 1 - plogis((A^2 + W) / (A + W^3 + 0.5))
  Z <- rbinom(n_obs, 1, prob = z1_prob)

  # create outcome as a linear function of A, W + white noise
  Y <- Z + A - 0.1 * W + rnorm(n_obs, mean = 0, sd = 0.25)

  # full data structure
  data <- as.data.table(cbind(Y, Z, A, W))
  setnames(data, c("Y", "Z", "A", "W"))
  return(data)
}

# set seed and simulate example data
set.seed(75681)
example_data <- make_mediation_data(100)
node_list <- list(W = "W", A = "A", Z = "Z", Y = "Y")

# consider an incremental propensity score intervention that triples (i.e.,
# delta = 3) the individual-specific odds of receiving treatment
delta_ipsi <- 3

# make learners for nuisance parameters
g_learners <- e_learners <- m_learners <- phi_learners <-
  Lrnr_cv$new(Lrnr_glm$new(), full_fit = TRUE)
learner_list <- list(Y = m_learners, A = g_learners)

# compute one-step estimate for an incremental propensity score intervention
tmle_spec <- tmle_medshift(delta = delta_ipsi,
                           e_learners = e_learners,
                           phi_learners = phi_learners,
                           max_iter = 5)
tmle_out <- tmle3(tmle_spec, example_data, node_list, learner_list)
tmle_out
```
